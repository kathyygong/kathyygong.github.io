<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I am a junior at Georgetown University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Economics with a minor in Mathematics. Currently, my studies are focused on building a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and with my experience in languages such as C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and SQL, I am excited to engage in innovative and challenging projects as I pursue my interests in software engineering, networking, quantitative analytics, and cybersecurity.
<br><br>
<h3>My Journey</h3>
I wasn't always interested in computer science. In fact, as a young child in middle school, my mother suggested I pursue it as a career and I vehemently refused. I wanted to be a physician. I had wanted it for as long as I remembered. If there was one thing I was certain about, it was that I desired to help people. I aspired to make an impact, and the surest method I knew how was through medicine. In order to further my goal of working in healthcare, I collaborated with Professor Colvin at Brown University regarding biomedical research the summer prior to my senior year of high school. The internship was meant to be a lab-based, science experience, however when I arrived in Providence, we were informed that because of my age, I could not work in the lab (fatefully). The plan was quickly changed, and while I was still contributing work that would be significant and impactful, it was through a different means - technology. I ended up learning and utilizing a number of different analytical software and Excel to pinpoint issues with our nanoparticles and determine potential solutions that would render them more effective in areas such as cancer treatment and environmental cleanup. By the end of my experience at Brown, I was thoroughly intrigued by computer science, and opted to take a course in Web Development my senior year. Coding quickly became one of my passions, and with my combined experiences at Brown and fully building a website from scratch, I was impressed and fascinated by the versatility of computer science. While other fields and majors provide the knowledge necessary for a future career, computer science both offers the skillset required to succeed in a professional capacity and empowers individuals with a toolkit to make an impact from almost anywhere - either with a company or through personal passion projects.

<h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
<p>
Presently, I'm working on a couple of projects to explore my interests, learn some new languages, and build something fun. Feel free to take a look <a href="github.html">here</a>.
<br>
Some activities I enjoy in my free time include running (long distance + half marathons), tennis, participating in Hackathons, and hanging out with my dog Kylie (she's your typical fun Ausshole).
I previously participated in HoyaHacks, and will be attending HopHacks at Johns Hopkins University this upcoming September!
